## üåü Project Goal & User Persona

The primary goal was to ensure **efficiency** and **accuracy** for Alex. A college student needs more than a general search; they need specific ways to find textbooks and reference materials.

| Persona Feature | Implementation Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **College Student** | Focus on clean, academic-style UI for minimal distraction. |
| **Need for Precision** | Implemented four distinct, tab-separated search modes (Title, Author, Subject, **ISBN**). |
| **Quick Identification** | Prioritized displaying the Book Cover, ISBN, and Publish Year prominently. |

## üí° Solution Design & Component Breakdown

### Design Notes (Addressing Alex's Needs)

The core feature is the **four-mode search** powered by distinct Open Library API parameters, allowing Alex to find books efficiently:

* **ISBN Search:** Necessary for finding exact textbook editions quickly.
* **Subject Search:** Useful for finding required reading for a course (e.g., "geology").
* **Cover Display:** Ensures quick visual confirmation of the correct book.

### Component Structure

| Component | Purpose | Key Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`App.js`** | Main Logic | Dynamically constructs the API URL based on the user's selected search type (`title=`, `author=`, `subject=`, `isbn=`). |
| **`SearchForm.js`** | Input UI | Manages the active search type state and passes the query/type up to `App.js`. |
| **`BookCard.js`** | Single Result Display | Extracts the book cover ID (`cover_i`) to construct the separate Open Library Covers API URL for image display. |
** `BookCard.js`** |Single Result Display	Extracts the book cover ID (cover_i) to construct the separate Open Library Covers API URL for image display.
